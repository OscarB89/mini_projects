# It can be tricky to translate numbers into their roman numeral equivalent, write a program that takes a number between 1 and 1000 and returns the corresponding roman numeral.
#
# Brief guide to roman numerals:
# 1 = I
# 5 = V
# 10 = X
# 50 = L
# 100 = C
# 1000 = M
class RomanNumerals

  # VALUES = {
  #   "M" => 1000,
  #   "D" => 500,
  #   "C" => 100,
  #   "L" => 50,
  #   "X" => 10,
  #   "V" => 5,
  #   "I" => 1
  # }

  def self.convert(number)
    "I"
